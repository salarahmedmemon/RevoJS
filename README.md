# 🔥 Project: RevoJS ---> My Custom React.js (2025)

I built a lightweight React-like library from scratch to understand the core concepts of React.js such as:
- JSX to Virtual DOM parsing
- Custom `useState` hook for state management
- Virtual DOM creation and diffing
- Efficient DOM updates without full re-renders

This project helps explore how React works under the hood.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ JSX Support (via Babel)
- ✅ Custom `useState` Implementation
- ✅ Virtual DOM Structure
- ✅ DOM Diffing and Reconciliation Algorithm
- ✅ Event Handling
- ✅ Function Component Support
